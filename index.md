I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating on 2029 and getting a careeer in game development.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lap 8 Part 2

    I like in this Lab that we were able to calculate the average score. As it says in the instructions, whatever you put in for scores, be it decimals or integers, it would always calculate the average score between them all, and doing something like that always interests me because of how the code actually calculates the average scores.

* Lab 7 Part 1

     This will definitely be my hardest lab because I had to basically implement parking restrictions, which were hard for me to comprehend because I had to write the code that automated parking rules. We did 4 different streets, and though it was hard at first, once I started seeing the pattern to it, it got pretty easy, and I enjoyed this lab because it was my hardest lab.

* Lab 3 Part 2

     I find it very useful, even though it was a very simple Lab that we did. It's technically a BMR calculator because I personally made it, and if ever in the future, I could use this. I loved doing this lab because it showed me how I can also program to make certain calculators and just basically have my own personal BMR calculator without relying on some other websites.
